## API Example

As Python is commonly used to create APIs, I wanted to provide one real-world example of using hooks for state management in Flask. Note, that this is just one example and the library can be used in many other ways. See [examples](https://github.com/amitassaraf/python-hooks/tree/master/examples)
 for more examples.

See [Getting started](getting_started.md) for a quick tutorial on how to use the library.

See [Inspiration](inspiration.md) for a more in-depth explanation of the motivation behind this project.
